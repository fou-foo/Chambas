# How to read and interpret the set of notebooks

Points that I would like to emphasize are highlighted in __bold__, while _technical curious_ comments are in italics and my `personal opinions` are in backticks.

Each of the notebooks, `OneDevice.ipynb` and `PredictiveMaintenance.ipynb` contains three sections:

The first section `Landing the problem (from business and technical perspective)`, contemplates the points with the greatest link with the business such as: translate and correctly land the requirements of the various areas to propose technical, functional and above all __reliable__ solutions based on data to __add value to the business__, which can directly translate to an increase in __profits__, reduction in costs, process improvement, simplifying or improving them to __optimize time__. Therefore, some technical aspects are also discussed that allow to know, diagnose, and if possible, improve the data pipeline to increase their quality.

The second part `Frontlog`, contains some of the engineer, scientific and teamwork tasks (`because data analysis is a team sport`) that a member of a DS team should perform, concerning the search, investigation and prospecting of insights that provide a __competitive advantage to the business__ in the short, medium, and long term.

Finally, the third part `Sharing results and lessons learned`, includes comments and narrations on how to __share__, communicate and present __adequately__ at the beginning or end of a project or sprint the results of the team to clients or users with different backgrounds; with the purpose that the fruits of the team satisfy and exceed the needs of the audience to whom it is presented, that is, that they are adequate solutions to the __correct problems__.
